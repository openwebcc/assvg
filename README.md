#What is AsSVG?

AsSVG may best be described as a couple of efforts to enable and thus promote the use of SVG in Open Source GIS software. It started with a function to deliver SVG-notation from PostgreSQL with PostGIS called AsSVG() back in 2005. In spring 2008 v.out.svg was included in GRASS GIS 6.3 and in autumn 2008 PostGIS' ASSVG() function was ported to Spatialite, an extension that enables spatial data support in SQLite. Besides that there's a simple ArcGIS geoprocessing script with toolbox that you can find here.
